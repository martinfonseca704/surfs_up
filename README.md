# surfs_up

## Project Overview
  There's a plan, of a foolproof surf and shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals tours, but will need some real investor backing to get this off the ground. A strong business plan to reach out to an investor W-wavy who is famous for his love of surfing, but has one concern what about the weather he’s extremely serious about this he invested in the surf shop early in his career however he didn’t ask for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained out of existence W-wavy needs properly analyzed data and asked for some analytics on the weather dataset he has from the very island where where the shop will open.

- MAX TEMPURATURE:±2
- MINIMUM TEMPURATURE:±8
- AVERAGE TEMPURATURE:±4

## Conlusion
  Very even trend in tempuratures from June to December. In order for a more informative analysis, data from other factors such as rain, wind, previous typhoon trajectories, earthquakes, and tsumanis which would help deepen the analysis. Also population data & traffic data is another possible concept to deepen the analysis.
